The Student Finance Project was considered as a student oriented project and that is why a lot work on it has been undertaken. It is a project built using very common programming language, Python. With the help of the project you can easily add, edit, search and remove your transactions. Additionally you can even print the reports, breakdown your expenses in groups and look at the trend in expenses in the graph. A very plain concept is encouraged so that the task of managing one’s finances doesn’t feel burdensome.
